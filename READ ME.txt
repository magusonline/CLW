The main function of this GitHub group is to work
together and help each other learn C++ on a deeper
level. I chose to use this site as our host 
primarily because it has the ability to track 
repositories (public/private/etc) without issues.
The synchronization appears to be really fast given 
that it is just handling rather small .cpp files 
and/or some .txt files as well.
